# LKN
LKN a is new computer language.
LKN stands for “Language of Knowledge” or “Love for Knowledge”
LKN is a hybrid of a programming language and a rule engine.
The LKN interpreter is implemented in C++20.
The LKN syntax is inspired by Smalltalk-80.
As a programming language, the LKN has the following features:
* integer and real numbers.
* strings
* collections: Arrays, Double Linked Lists, Maps, Queues.
* comparison statements
* logical statements 
* blocks of code named and unnamed
* conditional statements
* loops
* classes
* rules
* multi-inheritance

LKN classes have attributes, methods, and rules. Class rules are part of multiple inheritance, along with class attributes and class methods.

Please check short introductory document [LKN in one line](./doc/lkninoneline.md).
There is an "examples" folder with some LKN code.
Many examples of algorithms in this folder are discussed in Robert Sedgewick's book:
“Algorithms in C++.” and ported to LKN.
Examples cover the following topics.

#### File:`simpleSieveEratosthenes.lkn`.
The file has the implementation of the prime number generator written in Lkn.

#### File:`FibonacciTest.lkn`.
The file has the implementation of the class Fibonacci with 3 methods of generating fibonacci numbers
* fibonacci with loop implementation
* fibonacciR with recursive implementation
* fibonacciA with array implementation

#### Files:`llist.lkn` and  `llistTest.lkn`
The file has the implementation of the linked list class.

#### File:`queuelTest.lkn`
The file has the implementation of the queue based on the above implementation of a linked list.

#### File:`Stack.lkn`
The file has the implementation of the stack based on above implementation of linked list .

#### Files:`binarytree.lkn`, `binarytreeTest.lkn`.
The file has the implementation of the binary tree.

#### File:`PriorityQueue.lkn`.
The file has the implementation of the Priority queue.

#### File:`Sorter.lkn`.
The file has the implementation of the sorting algorithms such as:
* selection sort
* insertion sort
* bubble sort
* shell sort
* partition sort
* quick sort recursive and non reqursive
* heap sort

#### File:`AVLTree.lkn`
The file has the implementation of the sorting algorithms such as:selfbalancing AVL tree

#### File:`classTest.lkn`
The file has the implementation of the classes and instances with multiple inheritance and its ”diamond problem."


_There will be more examples and docs uploaded._
