# LKN
LKN is new computer language.
LKN stands for “Language of Knowledge” or “Love for Knowledge”
LKN is a hybrid of programming language and rule engine.
The LKN interpreter implemented in c++20.
Syntax inspired by Smalltalk-80.
As a programming language, the LKN has following features:
* integer and real numbers.
* strings
* Collections: Arrays, Double Linked Lists, Maps, Queues.
* comparison statements
* logical statements 
* blocks of code named and unnamed
* conditional statements
* loops
* classes
*rules
* multi-inheritance

LKN classes have attributes, methods and rules. Class rules are part of multi-inheritance along with class attributes and class methods.

Please check short introductory document [LKN in one line](lknInOneLine.md).
There is examples folder with some LKN code.
Many examples there are port to lkn of algorithms discussed in Robert Sedgewick book:
“Algorithms in C++”.
Examples covers following topics.

#### File:`simpleSieveEratosthenes.lkn`.
File have Prime number generator written in Lkn.

#### File:`FibonacciTest.lkn`.
Implements the class Fibonacci with 3 methods of generating fibonacci numbers
* fibonacci with loop implementation
* fibonacciR with recursive implementation
* fibonacciA with array implementation

#### Files:`llist.lkn` and  `llistTest.lkn`
implementation of linked list.

#### File:`queuelTest.lkn`
implementation of queue based on above implementation of linked list.

#### File:`Stack.lkn`
Stack implementation based on above linked list implementation.

#### Files:`binarytree.lkn`, `binarytreeTest.lkn`.
Binary tree implementation

#### File:`PriorityQueue.lkn`.
Priority queue implementation

#### File:`Sorter.lkn`.
Implementation of sorting algorithms such as:
* selection sort
* insertion sort
* bubble sort
* shell sort
* partition sort
* quick sort recursive and non reqursive
* heap sort

#### File:`AVLTree.lkn`
implementation of selfbalancing AVL tree

#### File:`classTest.lkn`
implementation of Classes and instances multi-inheritance and it’s ”Diamond Problem”
